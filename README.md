# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly programming event in
December where participants solve daily puzzles.

In Western Europe we get the daily puzzle at 6 in the morning. I only allow
myself to work on it before my day job, from waking up until breakfast. The
difficulty is increasing during the month of December so I usually don't have
time to go past the first week and the quality of the code might be bad.

The most important is to have fun!
